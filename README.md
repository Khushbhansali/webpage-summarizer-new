Webpage summarizer
Web Summarizer is an intelligent and efficient web-based application designed to extract and summarize key information from any webpage. By leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, it automatically condenses lengthy articles, blogs, or reports into clear and concise summaries. The goal of this project is to help users save time and quickly understand the essential points of online content without reading the entire text.

The system takes a webpage URL as input, retrieves the main text content, and processes it through an AI-powered summarization model. It then generates a short and meaningful summary while maintaining the original context and readability. With its user-friendly interface, the Web Summarizer is ideal for students, researchers, professionals, and anyone who wants to consume information faster and more efficiently.

Built with a clean and responsive design, this tool ensures fast performance and seamless interaction. It can be easily integrated into other applications or extended to support multiple languages and summarization styles. Overall, the Web Summarizer demonstrates the power of NLP in transforming how we read and understand web content in today’s information-heavy world.
